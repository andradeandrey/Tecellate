\section{Other Possible Simulation Rules}

The rules outlined in Section \ref{rules} describe a minimal environment to test the utility and efficiency of Tecellate. The rules outlined in this section may add more interesting mechanics to the simulation.

\subsection{Food}

Under the \emph{food} rule, agents must search the grid to find food. If their coordinator calculates that their food counter is below zero, they disappear from the grid. This rule would give agent programmers incentives to introduce distributed communication networks to inform faraway agents of abundant new food sources.
