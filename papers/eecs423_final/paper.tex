\section{Introduction}

In recent years, the fields of artificial intelligence and robotics have produced independent robots capable of cooperative behavior, for example the CoDA project\cite{CoDA}. However, there is no general and accessible platform upon which to test the AI required for cooperative behavior. The Tecellate project helps to solve this problem in a small way by providing a distributed grid-based world inhabited by agents with simple communication abilities.
