\section{Conclusion}

The rules outlined in this paper provide a reusable, simple platform for testing distributed artificial intelligence algorithms that are relevant to real-world applications. The system as described and implemented allow for a simulation of the game world to be run at a large scale, making use of new resources across multiple machines.
