\begin{abstract}
    We want to build a simulation of a world in which autonomous agents can communicate using semi-realistic radio signals. The simulation itself can be distributed over multiple machines to allow for very large simulations. The purpose will be to test wireless ad-hoc network routing algorithms under arbitrarily harsh conditions.
    This project will be based on work done in the fall of 2010 in EECS 423 (Distributed Systems). The current implementation allows for very rudimentary setup and movement but not much else.

\section{Introduction}

Network simulations have become important tools for researching mobile networks. Most research groups do not have the ability to purchase and use thousands of mobile devices for research and have thus turned to simulation. However, as many previous simulation authors have noted, simulations will always sacrifice some element of realism. The authors have decided to take a novel approach in these sacrifices adding a new way to test wireless mobile networks.
