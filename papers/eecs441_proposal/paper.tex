\begin{abstract}
    We want to build a simulation of a world in which autonomous agents can communicate over realistic wireless connections. The simulation itself can be distributed over multiple machines to allow for very large simulations. The purpose will be to test wireless ad-hoc network routing algorithms under arbitrarily harsh conditions.
    This project will be based on work done in the fall of 2010 in EECS 423 (Distributed Systems). The current implementation allows for very rudimentary setup and movement but not much else.
