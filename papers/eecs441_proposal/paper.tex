\begin{abstract}
    We want to build a simulation of a world in which autonomous agents can communicate over realistic wireless connections for the purpose of testing wireless mesh networks and holding recreational AI competitions. The simulation itself can be distributed over multiple machines to allow for very large simulations.
    This project will be based on work done in the fall of 2010 in EECS 423 (Distributed Systems). The current implementation allows for very rudimentary setup and movement but not much else.

\section{Introduction}

In recent years, the fields of artificial intelligence and robotics have produced independent robots capable of cooperative behavior, for example the CoDA project\cite{CoDA}. However, there is no general and accessible platform upon which to test the AI required for cooperative behavior. The Tecellate project helps to solve this problem in a small way by providing a distributed grid-based world inhabited by agents with the ability to move, communicate, and be destroyed.
