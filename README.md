Tecellate

What is this?
-------------

The Tecellate platform has two functions: testing real-world distributed AI algorithms, and running AI competitions.

Project Status
--------------

I have essentially just begun. The system has been described and a baseline implementation exists, but is not generalized and needs more optimization.

Running It
----------

You need to have [the Go language toolchain](http://www.golang.org/) installed to compile the project. `make build` takes care of the rest.

To figure out how to run the thing, look at `config.json` and `Makefile`. More documentation will be provided when it makes sense.

Rules
